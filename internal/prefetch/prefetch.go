// Package prefetch parses a Windows Prefetch (.pf) record into its contents.
//
// The point of the package is that the interesting evidence is *inside* the file.
// Tyto's analyzer used to report only the container's first few fields and the .pf
// file's own MAC timestamps, which meant two things went wrong at once: on Windows
// 10 the file is compressed, so those fields were the compression container's magic
// read as a version number; and the MAC timestamps describe whatever copy of the
// file the analyzer happened to open, so a collected artifact reported the moment
// Tyto copied it rather than anything about the subject.
//
// A parsed record carries up to eight execution timestamps, a run count, the volumes
// the executable touched with their serials and creation times, and the full list of
// files and directories loaded during the traced runs. All of it lives in the file's
// bytes, so all of it survives being copied — which is what makes offline analysis
// of a collected Prefetch directory worth anything.
//
// Versions 17 (XP/2003), 23 (Vista/7), 26 (8.1), 30 (10) and 31 (11) are supported.
// **Versions 30 and 31 have been verified against real artifacts** — 241 files from a
// Windows 10 host, all variant 2, and 441 from a Windows 11 host with the record's
// hash matching the file name 441 times out of 441. Versions 17, 23 and 26 are
// implemented from the published layout tables and covered only by synthetic
// fixtures, which is a weaker guarantee and is why every layout is *validated* at
// parse time rather than trusted: see chooseLayout.
